### SIT315 - Module 1

#### Task 1
Using polling a loops, read a sensor activate an actuator depending on reading.

#### Task 2
Like the above, but instead we use an interrupt instead of polling.

#### Task 3
Task 3 deals with using multiple interrupts to connect multiple sensors to an arduino board.

#### Task 4
We extend the interrupts further since Task 3, adding on an additional interrupt using PCINT and setting a timer interrupt to switch a blue led on and off every 2 seconds.
